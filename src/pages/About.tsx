          ACM@UIUC is a student chapter of the Association for Computing
          Machinery, a professional society dedicated to advancing human
          capabilities through information technology. Founded in 1947, the
          Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is the largest and oldest
          international scientific and educational computer society in the
          industry today. Organized only a year after the unveiling of ENIAC,
          the first general purpose electronic computer, ACM was established by
          mathematicians and electrical engineers to advance the science and
          application of information technology.

          ACM@UIUC is a group of dedicated people who are interested in
          exploring the possibilities of computers and learning more about how
          to use and develop them. ACM is divided into Special Interest Groups,
          or SIGs, which focus on specific interest areas in computer science
          and computing. Each SIG holds its own meetings and is
          responsible for organizing its own activities and determining its own
          purpose. Several SIGs are project-based, with the majority of their
          activities dedicated to computing projects in their area of interest,
          often presented at Engineering Open House. Some SIGs run workshops and
          tech talks to discuss topics related to their interest group. To find
          out more about our SIGs, visit the home page and attend a meeting.

          ACM also hosts several general events, including social activities such as
          picnics, swim nights, activity weeks, game nights, outreach
          activities such as ACM Open House, Student Lecture Series, and
          educational activities for high school and middle school students,
          and the annual Reflections | Projections conference. All ACM
          activities and SIG meetings are open to the entire University
          community, regardless of computer experience and background.

          Executive meetings occur every other week, at which the
          direction of ACM is defined. Everyone is welcome to attend and make
          suggestions for new ACM groups or events. Decisions about such events
          and other important ACM matters are also made at these meetings.
